        <h2>Kindness</h2>
        <p>
          In the wild world of academia, my kindness is like a Swiss army rubber
          chicken – a delightful paradox! 🐔 I turn into the "Compassionate
          Crusader," handing out pencils and empathy during finals' mayhem. But
          in the academic arena, I'm the "Peaceful Pastry Provocateur," hosting
          "Peace and Cookies" bake-offs to distract rivals. 🍪😅 While not the
          fiercest competitor, I proudly wear the "Highlighter Sharing" crown.
          🏆💁‍♀️ It's all about scholarly grins and keeping this rollercoaster of
          learning jolly! 📚🎢😄

        <h2>Discontentment</h2>
        <p>
          Navigating academic challenges with the enthusiasm of a grumpy cat on
          a rollercoaster is quite the unique journey! 😾 It can magnify stress
          levels, making minor obstacles feel like epic melodramas. Sometimes, I
          find myself tackling my studies at the pace of a stubborn sloth on a
          tightrope, which, as you can imagine, isn't the most efficient way to
          stay sane or learn effectively. 🦥🤣 So, let's aim for a balanced and
          cheerful approach to our academic adventures! 🚀📚

      <!-- Difficulty Saying No Section -->
      <div class="trait-section difficulty">
        <h2>Difficulty Saying No and People Pleasing</h2>
        <p>
          My knack for avoiding "no" and aiming to make folks happier than a kid
          in a candy store can turn into a real academic acrobatics act! 🤹‍♀️ It's
          like signing up for every extracurricular club under the sun or
          becoming everyone's go-to homework guru while your own studies cry for
          attention. 🌞📚 But hey, even the funniest clown needs a nap, right?
          🤡 Learning to draw the line and giving your academic ducks their own
          pond to swim in is the secret sauce to avoiding "burnout" and
          maintaining a report card that doesn't resemble a rollercoaster!
          🦆🎢📝

      <!-- Hobbies Section -->
      <div class="trait-section hobbies">
        <h2>Hobbies (Video Games and Reading)</h2>
        <p>
          Ah, my hobbies of embarking on virtual adventures with amigos in
          pixelated realms and indulging in tales of fiction can turn into quite
          the academic escapade! 🎮📚 They're my trusty stress-relief sidekicks,
          swooping in to save the day when the textbooks threaten to launch me
          into orbit. 🚀 But beware, these pastimes can sneakily kidnap my study
          hours in the name of fun! 🦹‍♂️ Finding that Goldilocks zone between
          leisure and academics is my quest – not too hot (game over) and not
          too cold (flunksville), but just right for maintaining top-tier
          academic hero status! 💪📖

        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <img src="/Assets/hero.png" alt="Image of My Hero" class="hero-image" />
        <p>
          Arfa Karim, my hero, has left an indelible mark on the world of
          technology, and her enduring influence continues to inspire countless
          individuals, myself included. In her own words,
        </p>
        <blockquote class="hero-quote">
          "Never underestimate yourself. You are much more capable than you
          think."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Arfa's legacy holds special significance as she hailed from Pakistan,
          a nation that faced international challenges. She illustrated that
          talent transcends boundaries, instilling a sense of pride in
          Pakistanis like myself. I am determined to follow in Arfa's footsteps,
          aspiring to emulate her perseverance and commitment to excellence,
          with the goal of uplifting my nation, just as she did

      <!-- Personality Test Results Section -->
      <div class="trait-section personality-results">
        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <img src="/Assets/Personalitytest.PNG" alt="Personality Test Results" />
        <p>
          I took the Keirsey Temperament Sorter test and got "Idealist." It
          feels right because it matches how I act and think. The test's
          questions really seemed to get what I like and how I behave. Being an
          Idealist means I care a lot about my beliefs and have a strong purpose
          in what I do. I also value being real, coming up with new ideas, and
          having deep connections with people, and the test pointed this out. As
          for the test's accuracy, it's helpful, but it's not perfect. The
          questions focus on some parts of your personality, but people are more
          complicated than that. Also, your answers can change based on how you
          feel that day. So, it's a good guide, but don't take it as the whole
          truth about yourself.
